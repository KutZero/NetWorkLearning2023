In cases where we need to define a lot of environmental variables and/or
run a few containers we could use docker compose option.
To use it we need to create an directory which contain all projects
we want to lanch (with individual dockerfiles within) and a docker
compose file named "docker-compose.yaml".

docker-compose up - run docker compose
	-d - run on a background
docker-compose down - stop all composed containers

docker-compose.yaml structure:

version: <version>

volumes:
	<volume_name>:

services:
	<service_name>:
		build: <path_to_project>
		restart: <param>
		environment:
		-<env_variable_name>=<value>
<image_name>:
	image: <image_name>:<version>
	ports:
	-<outer_port_num>:<inter_port_num>
	volumes:
	- <volume_name>:<container_path>
	restart: <option>
