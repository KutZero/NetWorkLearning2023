Some python projects could have a massive list of dependencies
which are not so convenient to download separatly via pip
install command. 
To overcome this difficulty programmers invented a way to download 
all dependencies as packet. To use this method you need to create 
a file containing a list of all dependencies your app need in format
like "dependency_name==version<end line><next>".
After that you can run "pip install -r 
<path_to_dependencies_list_file>" to install all dependencies packetly.
